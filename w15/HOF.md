# My understanding
- My understanding of forEach has improved, the fact we were already doing higher order functions
is suprising but makes sense considering on how you broke it down. we are essentially writing a function within a function. I looked over some of our older code that utilized forEach to get a bit of a better understanding as well. For example how we utilized it in the render.js file for the array we created in the heading function.

# filter
- Allows you to filter out what you want.

- similar to forEach youstill have to say what each indvidual post is.

- make sure the syntaax is exact when writing out the key.

- to keep it short, you don't need to use return or brackets when writing out the conditonal statements.

# map

- iterates over every array and provides some type of function.

- utilizing map is similar to how we utilize forEach and filter.

- can reference other arrays.
